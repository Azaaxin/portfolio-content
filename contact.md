# I'm looking for internship/LiA!
I'm an experienced web developer with self-taught knowledge in Visual Basic, HTML, JavaScript and PHP. Right now am I studying web development to fill in the gaps and keep myself updated on the topic. This has given me a chance to learn Agile project management, UX and UI design, E-commerce and business, and more knowledge in PHP, HTML and JS. 

I'm a very driven person and I really enjoy solving problems and invent new things, I'm focusing on personal growth and regularly create new challenges for myself to make every new day better than previous ones!

If you are interested and want to know me better, contact me by mail or LinkedIn.
